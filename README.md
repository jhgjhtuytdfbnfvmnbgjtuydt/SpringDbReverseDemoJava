The sample MySql database can be found in https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/

This database is reverse engineered into this Spring Boot project by using JOOQ Gradle plugin.

Before running the project by using gradle bootRun, make sure that the database is already imported into your local machine.

Employee and Department API are exposed, some with paging and size capabilities.
